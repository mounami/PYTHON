# The print() function makes Python talk to you
# print() = "show this on the screen"
print("Hello, Mou!") # Text must be in quotes

# You can print numbers too (no quotes needed for numbers)
print(6)  # This is an integer (whole number)
print(3.5) # This is a float (decimal number)
print(True)

# Print multiple things at once (Python adds spaces automatically)
print('I am ', 29, 'year old')


name = input("What is your name? ") # input() gets user input
print("Hello, " + name + "!") # Greet the user by name
